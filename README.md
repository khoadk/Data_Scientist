**1. Project 1**: Mobile Games **A/B Testing** with Cookie Cats
- Cookie Cats is a hugely popular mobile puzzle game developed by Tactile Entertainment. It's a classic "connect three" style puzzle game where the player must connect tiles of the same color in order to clear the board and win the level.
-  In this project, we will analyze the result of an **A/B test** by **bootstrapping** where the first gate in Cookie Cats was moved from level 30 to level 40. In particular, we will analyze the impact on player retention.

**2. Project 2**: Apply the Sharpe ratio to real financial data using **pandas**
- When you assess whether to invest in an asset, you want to look not only at how much money you could make but also at how much risk you are taking. The Sharpe Ratio, developed by Nobel Prize winner William Sharpe some 50 years ago, does precisely this: it compares the return of an investment to that of an alternative and relates the relative return to the risk of the investment, measured by the standard deviation of returns.
